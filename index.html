       <p> Mary Slessor was a dedicated missionary in the late 1800s to early 1900s, with a vigor and passion that brought the Lord’s Kingdom to Africa. She is now noted as one of Africa’s top missionaries, and much of West Africa was evangelized due to the open door that Mary created for the next generation of missionaries to follow after her. Born in 1848 to a Scottish family, Mary would go on to transform the world with the Gospel.</p>
